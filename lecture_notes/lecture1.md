## UX Debt

In the product design process, it can be tempting, even necessary to choose fast and easy solutions. 

There are many reasons that this may happen, but most commonly, fast and easy solutions to problems are chosen to hit release dates in the short term. 

Over time, the shortcuts that are taken throughout this process build up and can create UX debt. 

UX debt is the accumulation of experiences issues that can lead to a loss of trust, traffic, amongst other user experience problems in the long run.

<br>

### Factors that Contribute to UX Debt

When you accumulate UX debt on a project, you’ll eventually need to invest additional time and effort to ensure the product is using the best approach to solve the users’ problems. 

Aside from working under tight timelines or project constraints, there are other factors that may also contribute to UX debt. These factors include:

<br>

#### Skipping user testing

Skipping user testing is big issue, largely because you won’t have the insight to understand the how your users are interacting with your product, and why they behave the way that they do. 

Skipping user testing before a product is built ensures that the time and effort of the development team is wasted. It’s extremely important that you prioritize user testing before a product is launched.

<br>

#### Ignoring brand styles or standards

If you ignore brand styles and standards while designing your application, you will need to come back and fix them at a later date. 

More often than not, this means launching an application that isn’t consistent with the current user experience.

<br>

#### Design by committee

Design by committee is another inherently dangerous process. Although brainstorming with your product team is an great idea, it’s important that a single person (or small team) is responsible for carrying out the design throughout the entire process. This ensures a smooth and consistent experience.

<br>

#### Lacking or disregarding the product vision

The product vision drives the entire user experience. The product vision dictates features that should be prioritized as well as features or functionality that should be ignored.

<br>

#### Little or no QA testing

<br>

#### UX Debt in the Agile Methodology

UX debt is especially common whilst working within the agile methodology. In the agile methodology, teams are pressured to constantly ship new features and functionality. 

If you’re constantly focusing on new features and functionality as a UX designer, you run the risk of losing sight of the experience as a whole.

<br>
<br>

## Identifying Opportunities

Arguably, the best way to identify problems is through user feedback. There are many ways to get user feedback, but user testing is likely the most common and well-recognized. 

User testing should happen on a regular cadence and should consist of all key user flows and tasks that users frequently do on your app or website. Conducting regular user testing will help you build a picture of the overall health of your user experience.

Remember, user feedback can be gathered in a variety of ways. This includes usability testing, surveys, user interviews, contextual inquiry, and numerous others. 

The most important aspect of gathering user feedback is ensuring that you gather it on a regular cadence. You can never have ‘too much’ user feedback. 

Gathering user feedback at multiple times throughout the design process will ensure that the product vision and design decisions being made throughout are not based on opinion, but fact.

<br>

### Gathering User Feedback

The user feedback that you receive should be reviewed with your team on a recurring basis. This includes product managers, developers, and anyone else involved in the creation of your product. 

Reviewing user feedback with your team provides an opportunity to discuss any lingering UX debt that may need to be addressed. This includes UX debt that was discovered through user testing, as well as UX debt that stakeholders or other members of the product team have discovered.


The way that you review your user feedback is up to you and the team that you’re working on. There is no one correct way to review or structure user feedback. 

You’ll need to focus on that type of data that you’ve gathered (qualitative or quantitave) and choose a way to visualize that information. You may decide to create a written report, a slideshow, an email, a Slack message, or any other method that you choose. 

When choosing the medium for disseminating user feedback, keep in mind that you want your team to be able to consume the information that you’ve gathered.

<br>
<br>

## Tracking and Prioritizing Issues

Once you’ve identified issues that need to be addressed, you’ll need to track and prioritize those issues through completion. 

When planning and prioritizing work that will get in a sprint, make sure that UX issues and debt get the attention they deserve by using using the same severity indicators that other items in the backlog use.

<br>

### How Tracking Leads to a Better User Experience

Your team should ask the question, `“what will improve the experience the most during the next sprint?”`. 

Sometimes, the answer will be a new feature. Other times, the answer may be making an existing feature more usable. Most of the time, making an existing feature more usable is of high priority. 

> Remember, a feature that users can’t use might as well not exist. 

Typically, UX problems with features that currently exist should get assigned higher priority than new features. Because features tend to be implemented in order of highest benefit, features that already exist are likely to be of higher value than new features.

<br>

### How to Prioritize UX Features

Before adding a feature to the backlog, you can organize and prioritize your issues in a spreadsheet. This will help the product owner effectively prioritize UX issues in-line with all other items that need to be completed. 

The NNGroup suggests the following factors to reveal the biggest pain points in the users’ experience:

> Description of the issue from users’ standpoint (how is it affecting them?)  
> Where in the experience it occurs (awareness, consideration, conversion)  
> Frequency of occurrence (how often does it happen?)  
> Who reported the issue? (user, team, stakeholder)  
> Level of UX and development effort needed to fix the issue (low, medium, or high)  

After each item is scored, you may use a prioritization matrix in the form of a scatter plot to see where the issues fall on the dimensions of user value and effort to fix.
