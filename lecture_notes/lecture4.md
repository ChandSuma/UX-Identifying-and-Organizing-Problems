## User Flows

User flows are a fundamental tool for every user experience designer. Creating them helps designers avoid missing key interaction moments and allows them to clearly articulate how users interact with their products.

A user flow is the visualization of a user’s complete path through an application, website, or software. The flow may be non-linear in the sense that they contain decisions nodes, alternate paths, and loops in order to show all possible interactions with the product.

In other words, they’re essentially flow charts of a user’s movement through an application.

We can create them for an existing product by actually observing the paths users take.

For a new project, we’ll need to use our research and come up with hypothesized user flows before we can validate them with testing.

We create user flow documents because they help us avoid missing key interaction moments. 

The process of creating a user flow frequently uncovers all possible scenarios of the users’ interaction with the application. 

It shows us places where we can use usability heuristics to improve the experience, e.g. helping rescue our users, keeping them out of trouble, or providing wayfinding tools to help them get through the flow with less friction.
