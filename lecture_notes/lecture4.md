## User Flows

User flows are a fundamental tool for every user experience designer. Creating them helps designers avoid missing key interaction moments and allows them to clearly articulate how users interact with their products.

A user flow is the visualization of a user’s complete path through an application, website, or software. The flow may be non-linear in the sense that they contain decisions nodes, alternate paths, and loops in order to show all possible interactions with the product.

In other words, they’re essentially flow charts of a user’s movement through an application.

We can create them for an existing product by actually observing the paths users take.

For a new project, we’ll need to use our research and come up with hypothesized user flows before we can validate them with testing.

We create user flow documents because they help us avoid missing key interaction moments. 

The process of creating a user flow frequently uncovers all possible scenarios of the users’ interaction with the application. 

It shows us places where we can use usability heuristics to improve the experience, e.g. helping rescue our users, keeping them out of trouble, or providing wayfinding tools to help them get through the flow with less friction.

## When Do We Create User Flows

Knowing when to use a user flow is just as important as knowing how to use one.

User flows are conducted at various points throughout the product design cycle because they’re the perfect tool for communicating what needs to happen in order for a user to accomplish something. We typically use them in the Discovery, Definition, Ideation, and Prototyping phases.

### Discovery Phase

In the Discovery phase, we construct user flows during our competitive analysis to better understand how our competitors’ users interact with their products. 

If we’re working on an existing product, we’ll create user flows for our own experience to map out the existing user interactions. These user flows serve as an invaluable form of documentation that broadens our understanding of the current state of affairs.

### Definition Phase

During the Definition phase, we’ll create user flows after we’ve synthesized our research into a user journey map. 

At this point, our user flows can be a bit more generalized than they typically would be in order to translate our big picture user journey map into a more actionable representation of our product. 

Ideally, we’re trying to articulate the high-level interactions a user needs to accomplish in order to derive value from the product.

### Ideation Phase 

These high-level user flows can then be taken over to the Ideation phase. As we brainstorm solutions, we can utilize user flows to map out the implementation details we need to consider in the solutions’ design. 

By increasing the specificity and fidelity of our user maps, they become incredibly valuable to our design process because they give us a blueprint for our design by mapping out the interactions and interfaces we need to consider.

### Prototyping Phase

Finally, in the Prototyping phase, we’ll use our user flows as supporting documentation and continuously improve them as we test solutions. That said, we can still continue to create new user flows as new features and other improvements arise.

Putting this all together, we can see what a versatile tool user flows are in our toolbox. While we’ve discussed how to use them in these parts of the product design cycle, they can be used anytime you need to communicate how a user interacts with your product.

## Understanding the Context

Like with most UX tools, we start creating our user flows by reviewing our research and context. From here, we can then iterate through different representations and create our user flow document.

We’ll review the work we’ve done up to this point by asking four questions:

> What solutions have we brainstormed?  
> What is the user trying to achieve?  
> What are the business objectives?  
> What are the points of entry?  


We start by reviewing and cataloging our current solutions because we want to design a user flow for each of them. 

Doing so will allow us to translate the abstract solution into a tangible interface. 

Then, for each solution, we’ll identify what the user is trying to achieve, our business objectives, and how the user would start using the solution. Once we’ve identified these key points, we can begin to connect the dots in the next step.

## Write Out the Flow

Before we plunge into “full design mode”, taking the time to write out our flows lets us rapidly develop and iterate them because it is much easier and faster to change text than a design. 

To do this, we’ll open up Word or Google Docs and we’ll write out a flow for each solution as a bulleted list.


In the beginning, we can focus on how our product will connect the user’s point of entry to their goal using our solution and meeting our business objectives.


As we complete flows for different solutions, we should take time to see if we can add any flows that link different flows and make sure we’re not just designing for the “happy path.”

## Design and Review the Flow

Once we’re satisfied with our written flows, we can begin to graphically represent them in our design software of choice.

To do so, we’ll typically represent each bullet as a card or another icon and then draw lines between them to represent how a user can progress through the flow.

We can vary the design of the cards and lines to represent different user activities. For example, we could make the “happy path” green and the other paths red.

<br>

Once we’ve finished translating everything into a graphical design, we can take a second to review our work and see if we’re missing anything.

When all of the connections have been made, it can be easier to spot gaps or flaws in your flows.

<br>
<br>

## Repeat With New Paths

Finally, as the project progress and you iterate through design solutions, be sure to continue updating your user flows so you have detailed documentation about how your users interact with your product.

Maintaining proper documentation of your experience with user flows will make your job significantly easier in the future when you need to revisit or test an experience.
