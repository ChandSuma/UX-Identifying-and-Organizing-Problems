## Journey Maps

Most organizations have a difficult time understanding how their customer interacts with their business. Oftentimes, information is siloed in different parts of the company and it’s rarely extracted for everyone’s benefit.

Furthermore, most organizations don’t take a user-centered approach to their daily operations. So, new initiatives and ideas are typically internally sourced and developed with little to no consideration for the user. Yikes!

### Refocus on User Needs

As UX designers, we need to be able to free up our organization’s information and refocus everyone on solving user needs. Fortunately, we can use a customer journey map to solve these problems.

What is a Journey Map?

According to the Nielsen Norman Group (NNGroup):

>> ”A customer journey map is a visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal.”   

They combine storytelling and visualization to help teams conceptualize and address customer needs. Their unique format and ability to surface missing details make them excellent tools for defining the high-level customer experience.

Additionally, they help draw out siloed information because they’re created using a collaborative, multi-disciplinary approach. And since we’re focused on the customer’s journey, it refocuses the team on the customer’s needs and pain points.
