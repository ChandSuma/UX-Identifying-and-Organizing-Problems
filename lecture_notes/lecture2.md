## Personas

Personas remind us that we’re designing for real human beings and help us keep the user as our design focus. 

The following quote from Leah Buley, _The User Experience Team of One: A Research and Design Survival Guide_ illustrates this concept well:

>> “A persona is a composite picture of a collection of users boiled down into one relatable, human profile.”  

They are statistically and research derived representations of our users. We use statistics to provide demographic context and our research to fill in our understanding of their motivations, desires, and needs.

<br>

### One Persona Per Archetype

We typically will design one persona to represent our primary user archetype, but it pays to be specific.

>> “For example, in designing clinical products, it might be tempting to lump together all nurses as having similar needs. However, if you have any experience in a hospital, you know that trauma nurses, pediatric intensive-care nurses, and operating room nurses are quite different from each other, each with their own attitudes, aptitudes, needs, and motivations. Nurses new to the role look at their work differently than nurses who are veteran to the job. A lack of precision about the user can lead to a lack of clarity about how the product should behave.”  
 - Alan Cooper, _About Face_

So, when creating personas for a product, we need to make sure we design one for each user archetype.

Sometimes we can’t conduct enough research to design a proper persona, but we still want to keep our users at the center of our design thinking. We can use proto-personas to solve this dilemma for us.

<br>

### Proto-Personas

A proto-persona is the same thing as a persona except we do not use statistics or research to create it. Instead, we use our professional experience and stakeholder information to create our best guess of our users’ archetypes.

>> “Proto-personas are less scientific and rigorous than traditional personas, but they can be equally effective for helping a team shift into a more empathetic mindset about users’ needs.”  
 - Leah Buley, _The User Experience Team of One: A Research and Design Survival Guide_

Outside stakeholders are often confused about the value of personas. Being able to explain their value will make using them and interacting with your team easier.

<br>

### The Value of Personas

Personas are valuable because they remind us that we’re designing for real human beings and they force us to distill all of our research into one, usable reference. Not only do they promote this critical empathy, but they also communicate the essential characteristics of our users so we can tailor our design thinking towards their specific needs.

In other words, they help us prioritize our design solutions so we don’t try to build a product that attempts to please everyone. Additionally, when well-designed and shared correctly, they are a useful tool for facilitating stakeholder buy-in.

## Using Personas

#### Remember Your Persona

Personas suffer from the unfortunate dilemma of being created and then never used again. 

This typically happens because the design team treats personas like a checkbox in their design process and other stakeholders don’t see the value in having a representation of their users. Knowing how to use them alleviates this issue.

In our trusty product design cycle, we’d typically create a persona during the `Definition` phase as we synthesized all of our research. Creating personas earlier in the process also lets us reap their benefits throughout the rest of the design cycle. 

So, how do we go about using them once they’ve been created?

<br>

### How to Use Your Persona

First, be sure to explain to everyone involved why you’re creating user personas. 

A lot of non-designers have never heard about or seen a persona, so it takes them a bit of extra time to see the value. 

They also don’t typically understand the benefits of user-centered or user-first thinking, so this can be another opportunity to reinforce those concepts.

<br>

Second, try and make your personas as visible as possible. If you work in a team, make sure they’re posted in a highly visible spot, or print them out and frame them on your desk. 

If you work remotely, try making it your computer background - if you have multiple, make sure you set them up to rotate. 

If you have a big stakeholder meeting, print them out and post them on the whiteboard or wall. 

There are even teams who get life-size cut-outs made too! 

Keeping them center stage helps keep them at the top of everyone’s minds and more likely to be used.

<br>

Third, when you’re talking about a user or your users, try replacing the word “user” with the name of your persona. 

By using your persona in place of the generic user, you’re consciously making the effort to design with your persona in mind and you’re modeling behavior to your entire team.

<br>

Finally, as you continue through the design process, make sure you check in with your persona. 

As you create user flows, journey maps, wireframes, mockups, etc., make sure to remember that you’re creating them for your persona. Keeping them visible will help, but it’s up to you to make the effort and try to design your experience through their eyes.

Used and created correctly, personas are a powerful tool that promotes a shared understanding of who we’re designing for and help us prioritize our design efforts so we don’t build Frankenstein products that please no one. 

Most importantly, they remind us of the humanity involved in the design process and help us focus on designing solutions for a human being and not some abstract user.
